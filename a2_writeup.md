# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

The match functions were pretty diffiuclt to me. I was not aware how to deal with trailing spaces or even what append was, but I eventually fgured it out and have a little bit of a better understanding. Also the code went into an infinite loop and that was another struggle.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

A movie database will have a lot of source information that my program can loop through with a few extra changes. For example if the movie database has 1000 movies I expect to be able to loop through all the movies and do 1 match for each.
